The HC-SR04 sensor is a Ultrasonic sensor. we can not use this sensor direct in a 
circuit. We need a microcontroller for communication with the sensor. I use arduino in this case.

## Lessons Learned

The HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Distance Sensor is a sensor used for detecting the distance to an object using sonar. It's ideal for any robotics projects your have which require you to avoid objects, by detecting how close they are you can steer away from them! 

The HC-SR04 uses non-contact ultrasound sonar to measure the distance to an object, and consists of two ultrasonic transmitters (basically speakers), a receiver, and a control circuit. The transmitters emit a high frequency ultrasonic sound, which bounce off any nearby solid objects, and the reciever listens for any return echo. That echo is then processed by the control circuit to calculate the time difference between the signal being transmitted and received. This time can subsequently be used, along with some clever math, to calculate the distance between the sensor and the reflecting object!
